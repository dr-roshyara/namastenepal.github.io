Install Microsemi Libero 12.1 on Ubuntu 18.04

Sep 23, 2019

This is how I installed Libero SoC v12.1 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver). What helped me a lot where the instructions to install Libero on Debian and Arch Linux
Get License

Create a directory for the license server (here I use ~/.local/microsemi/license)

mkdir --p /home/USERNAME/.local/microsemi/license

Download the “Linux Licensing Daemon” from https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/design-resources/1711-licensing#downloads to the license directory and extract it with

tar xf Linux_Licensing_Daemon.tar.gz

Create an account on and request a "Libero Silver 1Yr Floating License for Windows/Linux Server". You have to enter your MAC address (12 hexadecimal digits without colons), which you can get by typing

ip link | grep ether

The license file is sent via email. Store the license file License.dat in the license directory.

Now the first four lines of the license file must be edited, but not the rest of the file. In the first line, replace <put.hostname.here> by localhost. In lines 2 to 4 replace PATH by the absolute path to the license daemon directory. The first 4 lines schould then look like that:

SERVER localhost 112233445566 1702
DAEMON actlmgrd /home/USERNAME/microsemi/license/Linux_Licensing_Daemon/actlmgrd
DAEMON mgcld /home/USERNAME/microsemi/license/Linux_Licensing_Daemon/mgcld
VENDOR snpslmd /home/USERNAME/microsemi/license/Linux_Licensing_Daemon/snpslmd

Install the depedencies

sudo apt install lsb

And start the license server with

Linux_Licensing_Daemon/lmgrd -c License.dat -log /tmp/lmgrd.log

Install Libero

Download “Libero SoC v12.1 for Linux” from https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/design-resources/1750-libero-soc#downloads.

The downloaded binary is a self-extracting archive built with InstallAnywhere. Before executing it, set its execute bit must be set and some dependencies have to be installed:

sudo apt install libxtst6:i386 libqtgui4:i386 libxrender1:i386 apt-file
chmod +x Libero_SoC_v12.1_lin.bin
./Libero_SoC_v12.1_lin.bin

Now the graphical installer should be launched. If not, there are still some library dependencies unresolved. From my experience, the console mode installation does not work at all. Quit it by typing quit and try to install additional X or Qt libraries until the graphical installer is started.

Within the graphical installer, I recommend to change the install path to /home/USERNAME/.local/microsemi/Libero_SoC-v12.1 and the common directory to /home/USERNAME/.local/microsemi/common. Otherwise you need root permissions whenever Libero updates the IP cores.

libz must be removed:

rm /home/USERNAME/.local/microsemi/Libero:SoC-v12.1/Libero/lib/libz.so.1

Install dependencies:

sudo apt install libmotif-dev libglib2.0-0:i386 libfreetype6:i386 \
    libsm6:i386 libfontconfig1:i386 libpulse0:i386 libqt5gui5:i386

libpng12-0 must be installed manually (source: https://www.linuxuprising.com/2018/05/fix-libpng12-0-missing-in-ubuntu-1804.html). Both the 32 bit version (for Libero itself) and the 64 bit version (for the chip planner) are required.

wget http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/libp/libpng/libpng12-0_1.2.54-1ubuntu1.1_i386.deb
wget http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/libp/libpng/libpng12-0_1.2.54-1ubuntu1.1_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./libpng12-0_1.2.54-1ubuntu1.1_i386.deb
sudo apt install ./libpng12-0_1.2.54-1ubuntu1.1_amd64.deb

The Libero scripts have the shebang #!/bin/sh although bash syntax is used. Therefore dash must be disabled by

sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash

and choosing “No”.

Before actually starting Libero, some environment variables have to be set:

export LM_LICENSE_FILE=1702@localhost
export SNPSLMD_LICENSE_FILE=1702@localhost
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/:/usr/lib
/home/USERNAME/.local/microsemi/Libero/bin/libero

Install SoftConsole 6.0

Dpendencies:

sudo apt-get install build-essential libstdc++6:i386

Download the Installer and make it executable:

chmod +x Microsemi-SoftConsole-v6.0.0.116-Linux-x86_64-Installer
./Microsemi-SoftConsole-v6.0.0.116-Linux-x86_64-Installer

Accept the license and set the destination location to /home/USERNAME/.local/microsemi/SoftConsole_v6.0

Avoid root permission when accessing SoftConsole hardware:

sudo cp ~/.local/microsemi/SoftConsole_v6.0/openocd/share/openocd/contrib/60-openocd.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
